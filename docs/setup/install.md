# Install

[Download](https://mastercomfig.com/download) the VPK files of your choice and then
drag them **directly** to your `tf/custom` folder. Do not put the VPKs
in a folder inside your `custom` folder, put them in the `custom` folder itself.
You don't have to rename anything either, just drag the files as is into `custom`.

The VPK includes everything needed for the config to run, so you don't need to
have an autoexec or run it using anything. If you already have an autoexec,
you'll definitely want to read on for more information on how to migrate
to mastercomfig. **Don't edit the VPK either, a later step has customization instructions.**

To get to `tf/custom`, right click Team Fortress 2 in your Steam library, click
**Properties**, go to the **Local Files** tab, and then click the
**Browse Local Files...** button. Then in the files app that appears, open the
`tf` folder and then open the `custom` folder.
